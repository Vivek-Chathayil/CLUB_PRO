# ClubPro

**ClubPro** is a comprehensive, modern web application for managing club operations, from member tracking to financials and events. Built with React and TypeScript, it features a sleek, responsive, dark-themed UI and provides distinct, feature-rich portals for both administrators and members.

The entire application is powered by a sophisticated mock API service, allowing it to function as a full-stack, interactive prototype without requiring a live backend server.
